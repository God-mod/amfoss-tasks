I don't exactly have a Hackerrank username as such coz I login to Hackkerank via my Github account. All the problems which I was able to solve can be viewed under adityar032002 (my hackerrank handle).  I have used Java for all the programs as that's the only language I know. Only after listening to the CS50 lectures did I realise  that coding in other languages would've been easier. Eg:- Coding in Python. Unfortunately, by the time I understood the basics of C and Python, I ran out of time. Still, the java code works fine.
