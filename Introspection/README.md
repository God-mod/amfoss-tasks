## Why must we choose you?
 
Coding is one of the few treasures which bring colour into my life. To input something quite arcane looking and get a seamlessly logical and beautiful output gives me a serious kick and a sweet release of dopamine. The satisfying feel of getting your code functional after several debugging sessions, can't be found anywhere else. All of this not only conveys my love for the software field but equally displays my perseverance and determination to get the code right, as perfect as possible.  Long story short, I take coding quite seriously and am very keen and open on learning new languages and aspects of this vast field. I specfically found amfoss more relatable than the other clubs because I am passionate about open source software. Open source is the answer to faster discoveries, inventions and collaborations. I respect the fact that software SHOULD be freely availabe for the newer generations to understand and learn the inevitable importance the tech sector has on our lives; to learn about it in much faster and more efficiently ways than the previous generations. My key strengths is that I don't give up easily, I don't lose focus at all, I am alwys determined to learn something new however difficult it may seem at first glance and finally but not the least is that I'm extrmely passionate about this field  
 
 ## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
 
Now that the tasks given to me has exposed me to the several sub branches in the vast field of open source software, I plan on diving deeper into all these new ideas much more thoroughly , until hopefully finding my passion by zeroing in on any specific area. I plan on learning more languages ( C & Python in particular for now ) in depth which will undoubtedly take me quite some time to learn properly and devloping the adequate muscle memory which will allow me to code in a more effect and versatile manner. I also hope to find a balance between my club work and my course work.
 
 ## How would you contribute back to the club?
 
 Hopefully, with all the knowledge gained, I really want to express my gratitude to the club by partaking in as many competitions humanly possible and win accolades the club truly deserves. I also hope to help create tasks for the new memebers in the coming years and guide and help them as well as my seniors have guided me. 
 
 ## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
 
 Not to point any fingers, but trying to finish these tasks in one month's time , in the midst of a global pandemic , in between online classes made me quite stressful and  frustrated at time. I do understand the club seniors were probably aiming to make the tasks resonably difficult and challenging, but personally 1 month didn't suffice at all, hence resulting in only a few tasks being properly completed . Other than that, I found the tasks extremely engaing an interesting. Even the seniors were friendly and helpful at all times thoughout the entire month.
