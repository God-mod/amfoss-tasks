# Tasks Update
Well, at first glance, I was a bit overwhelmed to be completely honest ( I still am ). All I can say is I tried my best. I've mainly used java for solving the tasks on Hackerrank as that's the only language I know thoroughly. I did understand C and Python through the CS50 lectures but never got the time to code and practice. Rest is in my introspection folder.
