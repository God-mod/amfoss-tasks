For hidden directories, I first used ls -a to view hidden directory. After finding the directory, I moved into the directory and again searched for more hidden files using same command. Finally I used "cat .hidden" to view file.

Level 5 to Level 6
There were a lot of files and I had to find a human-readable ,1033 bytes in size ,not executable file in sepcific. The code i used to locate such a file was "find -type f -readable -size 1033c -not executable "( not exaclty the same but somewhat similar code ).
cat .file2 gave me the right answer but cat ./-file2 didn't. why?

Level 6 to Level 7
I had to move out of the directory to "find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c" and among the code, found a very obscure "./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password" whose permission wasn't denied. Then after I "cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password" I got the password.

Level 7 to Level 8
In order to simplify my search in a huge file, I used "grep" to find the line number containing the word 'millionth' as " grep -n millionth data.txt " 
Level 8 to Level 9cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

Level 8 to Level 9
As the password is within the "only line of text that occurs only once", I used a combo of "sort" and "uniq -u" functions to sort the data.txt file in order and the latter to print out onlu unique lines. Hence the code being "sort data.txt | uniq -u "

Level 9 to Level 10
The clue given was 'one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters'. So just did a basic "cat data.txt" and read the code to find lots of '======' to find the password next to it.
